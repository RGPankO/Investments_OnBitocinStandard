# Monolith Refactoring Initiative

## Current Situation

The application suffers from severe architectural technical debt centered around a **5,583-line monolithic `public/app.js`** file containing a single `BitcoinGame` class that handles everything from routing to portfolio management to UI rendering. This makes the codebase extremely difficult to maintain, debug, and extend.

## Refactoring Goal

Transform the application into a well-organized, modular architecture with proper separation of concerns while **maintaining all existing functionality exactly** - no user-facing changes, only internal code organization improvements.

## Architecture Transformation

### From Monolith To Modular

**Current Problem:**
- Single 5,583-line file with one massive class
- Mixed concerns (UI + API + business logic + routing)
- Scattered backend routes with inconsistent patterns
- No clear service layer or component boundaries

**Target Architecture:**
```
src/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ client/              # Frontend: pages, components, services, utils
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ server/              # Backend: controllers, services, routes, middleware
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ shared/              # Common code between client/server
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ config/              # Application configuration
```

**Key Improvements:**
- **Streamlined app.js**: Reduced from 5,583 lines to under 200 lines
- **Service layer**: Proper business logic separation
- **Component architecture**: Reusable UI components
- **Controller pattern**: Clean HTTP request handling
- **Shared utilities**: DRY principles throughout

## Implementation Specifications

### Complete Implementation Plan
üìÅ **`.kiro/specs/monolith-refactoring/`**

- **`requirements.md`** - Detailed requirements and acceptance criteria
- **`design.md`** - Comprehensive architecture design and patterns
- **`tasks.md`** - Complete implementation plan with 12 major tasks and 24 subtasks

### Key Phases
1. **Foundation Setup** - New directory structure and shared code
2. **Backend Refactoring** - Services, controllers, routes organization
3. **Frontend Modularization** - Pages, components, services extraction
4. **Integration & Testing** - Gradual migration with feature flags
5. **Cleanup & Optimization** - Remove monolith, performance tuning

## Benefits

### Immediate Developer Benefits
- **Fast Bug Isolation**: Issues contained to specific modules
- **Parallel Development**: Multiple developers can work simultaneously
- **Easy Feature Addition**: Clear patterns for extending functionality
- **Improved Testing**: Each module independently testable

### Long-term Scalability
- **Code Reuse**: Components and services reusable across features
- **Performance**: Lazy loading and code splitting opportunities
- **Team Growth**: New developers can understand modular structure quickly
- **Future Features**: Solid foundation for complex feature development

## Technical Approach

### Functionality Preservation
- All existing user-facing features work identically
- API compatibility maintained throughout migration
- Database schema and Prisma integration preserved
- Translation system and mobile responsiveness maintained

### Migration Strategy
- **Feature flags** for gradual migration
- **Parallel development** - new architecture alongside existing
- **Comprehensive testing** comparing old vs new functionality
- **Safe rollback** capability at each phase

## Current Status

**Phase**: Planning Complete ‚úÖ
**Next**: Begin implementation starting with Task 1 - Foundation Setup

**Ready to start**: All specifications created, architecture designed, implementation plan detailed in `.kiro/specs/monolith-refactoring/` directory.

---

## Getting Started

To begin the refactoring work:

1. **Review specifications** in `.kiro/specs/monolith-refactoring/`
2. **Start with Task 1** from `tasks.md` - Create new directory structure
3. **Follow the design patterns** detailed in `design.md`
4. **Validate against requirements** in `requirements.md`

The refactoring will transform this codebase from an unmaintainable monolith into a modern, scalable application architecture while preserving all existing functionality.
