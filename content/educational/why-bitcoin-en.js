                    Bitcoin represents the first truly neutral, apolitical form of money in human history.
                    Unlike fiat currencies controlled by governments or gold tied to geographical locations,
                    Bitcoin operates on mathematical principles that cannot be influenced by any single entity.

                <p class="leading-relaxed mb-6">
                    This neutrality makes Bitcoin the ultimate measuring stick for value, free from the
                    manipulations and distortions that plague traditional monetary systems. When you
                    measure wealth in Bitcoin terms, you see the true opportunity cost of holding other assets.

                    Bitcoin's neutrality stems from its decentralized nature and mathematical foundation.
                    No government, corporation, or individual can alter Bitcoin's monetary policy. The
                    supply schedule is fixed: 21 million coins, with a predictable issuance rate that
                    halves every four years.

                        supply is mathematically constrained. This makes it the most neutral form of
                        money ever created.

                    for storing and transferring value, available to anyone with an internet connection.
