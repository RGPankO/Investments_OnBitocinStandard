                    The current monetary system, based entirely on fiat currencies backed by nothing
                    but government promises, is a historical anomaly. For most of human history,
                    money was tied to physical commodities, primarily gold and silver. The complete
                    abandonment of this link is a recent experiment that began in 1971.

                    This experiment has had profound consequences for wealth inequality, economic
                    cycles, and the very nature of money itself. Understanding how we arrived at
                    today's system helps explain why Bitcoin represents a return to sound money
                    principles rather than just another speculative asset.

                    Fiat money is currency that has value only because a government maintains its value
                    or because parties engaging in exchange agree on its value. Unlike commodity money
                    or representative money, fiat money is not backed by a physical commodity.

                    people agree to accept it. This represents a dramatic departure from thousands

                        trade, but these deficits undermined confidence in the dollar's gold convertibility.
                        This dilemma made the system's eventual collapse inevitable.

                    The transition to pure fiat money fundamentally changed the relationship between
                    governments and their citizens. Previously, government spending was constrained
                    by their ability to tax or borrow. After 1971, they could simply create money
                    to fund their activities, effectively imposing a hidden tax through inflation.
