                    Gold has served as money for over 5,000 years and remains deeply embedded in human
                    psychology as a store of value. Many people look to gold as a hedge against fiat
                    currency debasement and believe that a return to the gold standard would solve
                    our monetary problems.

                <p class="leading-relaxed mb-6">
                    However, when measured against Bitcoin, gold consistently underperforms, revealing
                    fundamental limitations that make it unsuitable as money for the digital age.
                    Understanding why gold failed as a monetary standard helps explain why Bitcoin
                    represents a superior alternative.

                    The classical gold standard operated from approximately 1870 to 1914, representing
                    the closest humanity has come to a truly global monetary system. During this period,
                    major economies fixed their currencies to gold at specific rates.

                    However, even during its heyday, the gold standard suffered from critical flaws
                    that would eventually lead to its abandonment. The system was rigid, deflationary
                    during economic downturns, and vulnerable to gold discoveries that could cause
                    sudden inflation.

                    discipline that gold demands. This pattern has repeated throughout history.
